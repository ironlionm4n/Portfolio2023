    Get Me Out (GMO) is a Unity 2D platformer where the player controls a test
    rabbit trying to escape from a lab accident. You must collect powerups and
    dodge enemies along your way to collecting keycards to navigate through
    levels. This game was made as a team of 5 for our Studio 1 and 2 class at
    Kennesaw State University. My participation in this project included
    creating player movement, jumping, and wall climbing abilities. I created
    the bat, mosquito and rat enemies. Also worked on the keycard and door
    system, implementing animations, creating tilemaps, power up system, dynamic
    difficulty adjustment, other various Unity engine items, and general bug
    fixes.

      Chiba is a Sudoku-like puzzle game where you must cut blocks of foods into
      the correct cut stage and place them on a goal tile. Several different
      levels are available in different worlds each world introducing a new
      mechanic to the player. I worked on player movement, item pusing,
      tilemaps, integrating sound and music, puzzle design, scene management,
      UI, screen transitions, performance system, other various Unity engine
      items, and general bug fixes. This game started a class group project but
      a few of us further polished it after the class ended.
